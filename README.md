# Naut for RES

Naut is a CSS theme you can use on [Reddit](http://www.Reddit.com). It's free to use, any Subreddit can use and edit it. Visit [/r/Naut](http://www.Reddit.com/r/Naut) to preview the theme.

## THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS, NO RELEASE YET.

### Goal
Naut looks pretty good, but RES seems to have problems integrating it. 
Trying to port Naut to RES.

### WIP
I'll start with nightmode first, as this is the one I use.
I'll go with colors from my [Brackest Bluemist theme](https://github.com/Huygenz/brackets-bluemist) first, as everything here is Bluemist atm.

## Installation

1. Navigate to `/r/YourSubreddit/about/stylesheet`.
2. Paste the CSS from the `Naut 4 - Main CSS File.css` file into the Stylesheet text area.
3. Upload the images from the `/Images/` folder, be sure not to rename them.
4. Save!

You may now customize Naut by either adding your own unique CSS Styles after Naut, or by visiting the [Naut Addons Repository](https://github.com/Axel--/Naut-for-reddit/tree/master/Addons)!
