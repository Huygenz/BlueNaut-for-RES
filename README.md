# Naut for RES

Naut is a CSS theme you can use on [Reddit](http://www.Reddit.com). It's free to use, any Subreddit can use and edit it. Visit [/r/Naut](http://www.Reddit.com/r/Naut) to preview the theme.

## THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS, NO RELEASE YET.

### Goal
Trying to port Naut to RES.
Changing colors to fit my [Bluemist theme](https://github.com/huygenz/brackets-bluemist).

### WIP
It's still missing much stuff but if you want to give it a go, you can link RES to this Stylesheet:
